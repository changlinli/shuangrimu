<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This is a blog about a variety of things, but with a bit of a focus on math and
programming. It aims to be a small repository of mainly information about small
things I stumble through as well as the occasional opinion about something.</p>

<p>It's a small hope that the hours and days I spend debugging and hacking around
things help at least one other person.</p>

<p>Note that all posts on this website are available in Markdown form and/or
LaTeX form if you would prefer to consume things without the noise of
HTML/CSS/Javascript getting in the way. Simple change the suffix of a post's
web address to <code>.md</code> or <code>.tex</code>. The LaTeX support is
slightly rough right now; you have to manually add a preamble before it will
compile.</p>

<p>The slider above should have some of my most recent posts (unless you have
Javascript disabled in which case you will only see my most recent post and be
unable to use the slider): below are some of my more popular ones.</p>

<h2>Popular Posts</h2>

<ul>
    $for(popularPosts)$

<h2>The code behind this site</h2>

This site is built with Hakyll and its code is contained in a literate Markdown
file. For readers interested in using Hakyll for their own site, you can look
at the code <a href="/site.html">here</a> and use it as a tutorial.
