<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This is a blog about a variety of things, but with a bit of a focus on math and
programming. It aims to be a small repository of mainly information about small
things I stumble through as well as the occasional opinion about something.</p>

<p>It's a small hope that the hours and days I spend debugging and hacking around
things help at least one other person.</p>

<p>The slider above should have some of my most recent posts (unless you have
Javascript disabled in which case you will only see my most recent post and be
unable to use the slider): below are some of my more popular ones.</p>
