 The unofficial summary is essentially feel free to use the work you see on this
site in both commerical and non-commercial uses. I only require that you
attribute me (either Rimu Shuang or my actual name) in whatever derivative works
my work is used in or in any locations my work is used in. If there are
exceptions, they will be noted where the work appears (usually this is in the
case of work I get from third parties, which may have a more restrictive license
such as a requirement that derivative work be used in a noncommercial context or
various copyleft requirements).
