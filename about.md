I'm Rimu Shuang. That's not my real name, but being the internet, I don't
anticipate it would be too difficult for you to track down my real name. It
does, however, give me less pressure when writing my blog posts as opposed to
using my real name :).

I was once an undergraduate wading my way through mathematics. Now I do a bunch
of coding.
