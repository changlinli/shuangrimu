This is a follow-up to my previous post
[https://shuangrimu.com/posts/elm-extensible-unions.html](https://shuangrimu.com/posts/elm-extensible-unions.html).

Since then there's been a lot of interest in the associated [Elm Discourse
thread](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/idea-extensible-union-types-and-benefits-they-bring-for-real-world-elm-code/6118).

Evan asked for a more formal treatment than the previous post, so here I give
one.

It involves a lot of math symbols so I've typed it up in LaTeX and made it a
PDF. The link is
