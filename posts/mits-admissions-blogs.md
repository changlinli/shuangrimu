MIT’s admissions blog has been having a bunch of interesting blog posts
up lately, either in a foreign language or in some sort of code.

Here’s a listing of the ones so far that been put up.

-   [Inserting “ub” in front of every vowel that’s not
    “u.”](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-quick-hello)

-   [Written in
    Chinese](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/new-york-and-me)

-   [Written with what appears at a first, quick glance to be a
    substitution cipher.](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/v9w) I
    would guess off the bat that “[” is “e,” but there’s a cool way of
    doing substitution ciphers *completely automatically* using a large
    preexisting English corpus, which I hope to get into in a later blog
    post.

-   [Spanish, Arabic, Chinese (handwritten), French, and a language I
    don’t recognize that’s
    handwritten](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hola.-no-hablo-espanol)

-   [Written in
    French](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/est-ce-que-je-suis-pret-peut-etre)

-   [Musical notes, again a substitution
    cipher](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-ode)

-   [Probably a weird font, so another substitution
    cipher](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/whoa)

-   [Written in
    French](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/une-experimentation-de-lindependance-partie-la-troisieme)

-   [Written in Morse
    Code](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/une-experimentation-de-lindependance-partie-la-troisieme)

-   [Written in
    Japanese](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/lets-cook)

-   [Written in a binary ASCII
    representation](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/lets-cook)

-   [Written with flags](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/lets-cook)

-   [Google tells me this is in Igbo, a Nigerian
    language](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/o-bu-nkita-nime-ulo-akukwo)

I hope ultimately to get all of the non-foreign language entries
translated (especially since once I show the automated substitution
cipher, all the substitution cipher ones should be done at once). For
now, I’ll translate the binary one (written originally by [Erick
P.](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/erick/archives) at this
[link](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/zero-zero-one-one-one-one-one-one))
because it’s simple and caught my eye. The typos should be from the
original (although I didn’t really check my code at all so it’s possible
that I messed something up in translation).
