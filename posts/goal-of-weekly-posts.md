I've decided to try committing to a post a week using the excellent
[Beeminder](http://www.beeminder.com "Beeminder") web application.  A user makes
a pledge to do something consistently over some perod of time with Beeminder and
Beeminder will charge the user money if he or she fails to live up to this
pledge.  Of course data collection relies on the honor system (the user has to
enter in the information manually), but it's a fairly good reminder since it
force the user to actively lie in order to get around things.  For anybody who
has yet to try it, I would recommend giving it a go; it's a great way to stay
motivated on various projects!

So hopefully I'll be able to get those weekly posts rolling starting now (or
risk losing money in the process.
